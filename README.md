🏆 About the Project
This project was developed during the EESTech Challenge, a 24-hour hackathon focusing on gamification and inclusion. Our team built Revo, an app designed to help neurodivergent individuals manage stress through breathing exercises and a simple, engaging game.
We are proud to have placed 2nd in this competition!
